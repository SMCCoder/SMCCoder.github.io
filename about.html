  <p>I am an undergraduate student studying in bioinformatics at the Rochester Institute of Technology. There, I have learned several skills such as R, Python, Java, C++, and ArcGIS. I have also had the chance to participate in several research oppurtunities, namely the RIT HHMI Inclusive Excellence Summer Research Fellowship Program and the Rochester Institute of Technology Research Initiative for Scientific Enhancement. Working in these research programs has fostered my interest in bioinformatics and ecoinformatics, which can be defined as an interdisplinary approach to biology and ecology, utlizing computer science, statistics, and mathematics. </p>
